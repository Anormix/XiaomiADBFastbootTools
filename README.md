# XiaomiADBFastbootTools
Reupload of Szaki's tools because they got deleted for some reason and I'm too lazy to search for 30 minutes EVERY TIME I need them!

You will need to have Java installed. (Pretty sure it works with every Java version from 8 to the newest)
If you are using Linux you may have to download adb and fastboot yourself. On Windows, it downloads them automatically.
